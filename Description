SHA-256 Password Cracker

This Python script is a simple password cracker that utilizes the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to crack hashed passwords. It takes a list of passwords or dictionary words, hashes them using SHA-256, and compares the resulting hash values with a target hash provided by the user. If a match is found, the corresponding password is identified.

Features:

Supports cracking of SHA-256 hashed passwords.
Uses a customizable list of passwords or dictionary words.
Provides an option for specifying a target hash to crack.
Usage:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).
Run the script using the command python password_cracker.py.
Follow the on-screen prompts to input the target hash and choose the password list.
Once the cracking process is complete, the script will display any matching passwords found.
Note:

This script is intended for educational and testing purposes only. Unauthorized use for cracking passwords without permission is illegal and unethical.
